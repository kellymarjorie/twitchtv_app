# TwitchTV 3rd Part App

A project as part of the FreeCodeCamp syllabus, this is a web browser app that uses the TwitchTV API to allow the end user to see all the TwitchTV streamers they follow and whether they are online or not. If the streamers are online, it gives the user information about what they are streaming and links through to the stream. It also allows the user to search TwitchTV for other streamers.
